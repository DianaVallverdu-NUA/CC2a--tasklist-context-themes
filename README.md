# Workshop

This workshop covered the definitions of main Node.js and React language. We started a To Do list that is left for homework to finish.

# Homework - Step 1

For next week, you will have to:
1. Create a new component 'Task' with:
- Props expecting a string element named 'description'
- Displays a horizontal 'View', containing a checkbox and the description text.
- An inner boolean state that handles whether the task has been checked as complete.
- A variable style that strikes through the task description when the task is complete.
2. From the `index.tsx` file, import the Task component and display a task with a description of your choice, e.g. "Finish Homework".

**Challenge:** How might you change the style of your Task?

# Homework - Step 2

1. Create a new component 'Add Task' with:
- An Input Text
- A Button 'Add Task'

**Challenge:** Can you use a state in your index.html to add tasks to the display?

**Additional Challenge:** Can you add a 'Remove Task' button to the Task component, that removes said task from the list?
